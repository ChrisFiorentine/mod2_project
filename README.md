Mod 2 project 

# Introduction

The objective of this project is to use a linear regression model to to predict an outcome of a specific dependent variable. The task is to examine a data set and use the features provided to build your linear regression model and predict an outcome. I choose a college basketball set from 2015 to 2019 to build a linear regression model to predict wins using the features provided in the dataset. 

# Questions to be Answered

1. What features should be used to best fit into a linear regression model to predict the most accurate outcome?
2. Are there features that may be multicollinear and confuse the model?
3. How accurate is the model?
4. What should coaches focus on in practice and creating a gameplan to produce the most wins?

# Steps

- Import a data set that you would like to build a model with.
- Examine the data using EDA.
- Answer any hypothesis questions you may have.
- Decide which features to use in your model.
- Fit and test the model. 
- Make adjustments to the model that are neccary.
- Provide reccomendations using the predictions from the model.

# Data Analysis

By building a linear regression model using the features provided in the data set, specific conclusions were drawn. 
The recomendation made was that coaches should focus on offensive efficiency, defensive efficiency, and three point shooting as well as defending the three point line. These features held the most weight in producing wins. As a result, coaches should spend most of their preparation time to come up with ways to make their offense and defense as efficient as possible. By doing this it means they will have to focus less on other areas. These areas they should focus less on are rebounding, and turning the ball over.

# Conclusion

The model was fairly succesful in predicting wins using the features provided. With more stats maybe from other data sets, the model would be even more accurate. Offensive and defensive efficiency led the way in predicting the model. There are more ways and other areas should also focus on, however with the data set given and statistics provided, focusing on Offensive and defensive efficiency will be the most effective in producing wins as a team.
